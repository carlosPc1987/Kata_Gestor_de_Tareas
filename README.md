# 🗃️ Kata: Task Manager

## ⏱️ Estimated Duration

* 15 minutes

---

## 🎯 Overview

This project focuses on implementing a simple task manager. The exercises explore basic object-oriented principles and Test-Driven Development (TDD) by allowing users to create, complete, and view tasks. The kata is structured in two phases, guiding the user from implementing code for existing tests to writing their own tests and implementation.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Java
* JUnit 5
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Git

## 🧩 Structure & Levels

| Level | Exercise | Description |
| :---- | :---------- | :---------- |
| **1** | **Phase 1: Guided TDD** | Implement the `Task` class to pass the provided unit tests, focusing on `Task` creation and completion. |
| **2** | **Phase 2: Full TDD** | Write and implement your own tests for a `TaskManager` class, allowing it to list pending tasks and count completed tasks. |
